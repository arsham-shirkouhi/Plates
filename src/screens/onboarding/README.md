# Onboarding Screen Refactoring

This folder contains the refactored onboarding screen components, split for better maintainability.

## Structure

- `types.ts` - TypeScript interfaces and types
- `constants.ts` - Constants like TOTAL_STEPS
- `hooks/` - Custom hooks for animations and logic
- `steps/` - Individual step components

## Refactoring Plan

The main OnboardingScreen.tsx (3573 lines) is being split into:
1. Types and constants (completed)
2. Animation hooks (in progress)
3. Step components (pending)
4. Main screen orchestrator (pending)
